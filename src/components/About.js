                        Thank you to everyone who supports this venture of mine. I wanted to build a platform for people like me that enjoy the BMW car culture. Make the process of sourcing and selling cars/parts simple and enjoyable to take part in.

                        A little back story... Growing up as a BMW mechanic's daughter, surrounded by everything from 3 series, 5 series & 7 series, it was always a dream of mine to drive these cars just like my dad.
                        
                        Fast forwarding to now, being in a male predominiant community I wanted to make my own wave in the culture. Build something that everyone can benefit from. While kindly saying "f*ck misogyny & the stereotypical assumptions" that come with being a woman apart of the industry. Now here I am taking my dreams to new heights. üôåüèº
